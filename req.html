<p>This is an attempt to insert a figure.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html image=&quot;../img/magic-8-ball.jpeg&quot; alt-text=&quot;The original analog version.&quot; figure-id=&quot;Figure 2.0-1&quot; caption=&quot;The traditional Magic 8 Ball. Does this wrap?&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; %} In <em>Figure 2.0-1</em> you can see a traditional analog Magic 8 Ball. This design utilized a plastic enclosed casing, filled with dyed water, suspending a 20 sided 3D shape. Each side of the 3D shape has a different message written on it. To use this device, the user holds it so that the 8 logo is facing up, asks a question, shakes the device, and then rotates it 180 degrees along the X axis so that the 8 logo is facing down. This results in a small window being exposed to the user which provides visibility inside the device exposing the 3D object contained within. The user then reads the answer to their question from the top most exposed side of the internal 3D object. Probability of a correct answer is 0.923512.</p>
<p>Only because I need more text to text the layout properties here, I'm giong to keep typing with no real purpose or message for the reader. This is really boring and I'd rather be doing something else. But come to think of it, at least I'm not doing laundry or dishes or scrubbing the bathroom. I guess there's always some silver lining. Hopefully I'll have enought in just a few more lines of test. Maybe it isn't so bad just to write one line of text then cut and paste it like I did in the introduction section to test the page rollover with headers and footers. That actually worked by the way, so I was pretty happy with that. Soon I've got to stop messing around with all the html and css stuff and get some java code written and pipelines defined. Maybe this is enough for now. Only one way to find out. Damn it, not quite. I need about three or four more lines to test the HTML layout. Of course I really don't care about the HTML, so maybe I should just take a look at the print layout. I wonder how I'll manage to print without paying $500 for that tool I found online. Well that's obviously out of the question. I wonder if something like Selenium supports menu clicks as well as page manipulation. Maybe some more research is needed on this subject before I get too crazy with it.</p>
<p>Hooray, it worked. Not to take a look at the print layout.</p>
