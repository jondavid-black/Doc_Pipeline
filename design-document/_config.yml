# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is the auto-generated software design document for the Magic 8 Ball.  This
  is an experimental approach to generate design documentation through a pipeline.
  Key elements of this experiment include - git CM control for document content,
  auto-generation of document content (e.g. requirements from repo, UML design figured,
  test data, etc.), and automated quality checks (e.g. spelling, acronym list complete, etc.). 
baseurl: "/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://localhost:4000" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
