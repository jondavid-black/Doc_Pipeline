The Magic 8 Ball currently has no plans of ever being deployed.

If you want to try and demonstrate this for yourself, it takes some setup of your host machine to ensure all dependencies are in place.  I have not done a good job of maintaining all the necessary dependencies.  I intend to correct this in a future version of the project.
