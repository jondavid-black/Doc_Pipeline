The Magic 8 Ball application is a digital representation of a well known toy (see Figure 1.0-1).  The toy has mystical powers to answer any question you ask.  You do this by asking the Magic 8 Ball a question, shaking it, and looking at the printed response on the bottom (note, you must invert the magic 8 ball to see this response).

This project will create a digital representation of the Magic 8 Ball toy.  The purpose of this is to provide a simple basis for demonstrating DevOps concepts and technology at the [DevOps for Defense Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-for-Defense/).  This project was created because of the simplicity of the implementation.  The point is to demonstrate DevOps solutions, not a fancy or complex software implementation.  This design document is an aspect of what can be done to improve configuration management and document delivery through automation using DevOps principles.  This is not meant to be perfect, but rather serve as an example for others to tailor to their needs.
### Web-Based Editor Test
This is a test edit.  I'm just trying to see how well the stackedit tool integrates with the version control aspects of GitHub.
